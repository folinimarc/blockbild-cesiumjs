# blockbild-cesiumjs
The german word "Blockbild" can describe a map showing a section of terrain as if it had been cut out of the Earth's surface. Select a square on the map and get a Blockbild in CesiumJs. Why creating a Blockbild if Cesium provides you the whole planet? Because its fun of course, and for some reason I enjoy a Blockbild so much more!
